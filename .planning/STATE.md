## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Vertical MVP slicing — Phase 1 is journal-only CLI; subsequent phases thicken with ZIP, secondary tables, lenient path, then PWA.
- [Init]: `bytes_to_tmppath` bridge is the foundational Phase 1 blocker — `dbfread` is path-only (issue #25, never merged).
- [Init]: PWA is Phase 5 and cannot start until the Phase 4 wheel is published to PyPI (micropip dependency).
- [Init]: TABL-03 typed readers require inspecting `pii-test-data/` archives for schema discovery — this work lands in Phase 3.
